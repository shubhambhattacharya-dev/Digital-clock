# Digital-clock
I am creating a digital clock using JavaScript functions and loops. Please correct it.



# Digital Clock
A simple and elegant digital clock implementation in JavaScript that displays the current time in 12-hour format with AM/PM indicator.
Features

# Real-time clock display
12-hour time format
AM/PM indicator
Leading zeros for single-digit numbers
Auto-updates every second

# How It Works
The clock operates through the following key components:
HTML Elements
The code expects the following HTML elements with specific IDs:

hour: Displays hours
minutes: Displays minutes
sec: Displays seconds
ampm: Displays AM/PM indicator

JavaScript Implementation
The main Clock() function:

# Time Calculation

Gets current hours, minutes, and seconds using the Date() object
Converts 24-hour format to 12-hour format
Determines AM/PM based on the hour


# Time Formatting

Adds leading zeros to single-digit numbers
Updates the display elements with formatted time
Handles AM/PM conversion for hours after 12


Auto-Update Mechanism

Uses setTimeout() to update the clock every second
Self-calls to maintain continuous updates
